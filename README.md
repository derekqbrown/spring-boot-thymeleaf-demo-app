# spring-boot-thymeleaf-demo-app

This app demonstrates the use of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf to allow users to register, login, and interact with a database.

To use this app will require setting up a database with matching fields to the objects mapped in the 'model' folder. I used PostgreSQL, but this should also work with MySQL or others by changing the application.properties file in the resources folder.
