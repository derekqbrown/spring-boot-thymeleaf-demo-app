# spring-boot-thymeleaf-demo-app

This application allows users to submit a leave request and allows a manager to either deny or approve the requests.

This app demonstrates the use of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf to allow users to register, login, and interact with a database.

For the database, I used PostgreSQL, but this should also work with MySQL or others by changing the application.properties file in the resources folder.
